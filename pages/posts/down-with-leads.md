# Salesforce's Lead Object

Pulled from a LinkedIn post just as an example post. I'll write it better later...

I don't know what Salesforce's Lead object is for and at this point I'm too afraid to ask...

Bit of a joke, and attention grabber, but seriously. I kind of get that it's built into Salesforce's workflow for the conversion process from lead to contact to create the opportunity which has some nice integrated metrics but is that really worth it when you can build your own workflows, processes, and reporting within Salesforce on your own? Or maybe it's good for B2C businesses? I guess?

It's especially confusing when we get into the world of ABM. A person should be associated to the company right away. You should be able to see engagement and intent-to-buy from the company immediately and set different metrics and levels of engagement and do your scoring for that company immediately. With the Lead, you don't get that.

Then there's systems like Salesloft and HubSpot that have it figured out and merge them into a Person (Salesloft) or a Contact (HubSpot, not to be confused with the Saleforce's Contact...).

I've also heard that some people just auto-convert Leads and Contacts and by golly, that's a lot to unpack. Just create the Contact immediately. 

Been scouring the web for support which I found but I also think this is just a nice reminder that everyone does it differently. Put down your pitchforks if you adore the Lead object. It works for some and not for others. There's a million different ways to do things, especially in marketing ops, but you should always be willing to look at things differently.
