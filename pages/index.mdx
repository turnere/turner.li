# Eric Turner

## Hi, I'm Eric.

Hey there! I'm Eric and I built this site to work with all that I'm learning about front-end development and to also showcase my resume for my career in marketing operations.

I expect to start writing random bits and bobs of blogs shortly so stay tuned for that. FYI: this page and the resume page will be real pages someday soon and not just markdown posts. :)

Otherwise, have a gander and add me on the socials below if you want to get in touch. 

-Eric
